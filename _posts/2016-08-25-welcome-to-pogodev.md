Welcome to PogoDev, the unofficial PokemonGO development community.

---

If this is your first time joining our community please be sure to read our [Rules](https://talk.pogodev.org/p/1-rules) and [FAQ](https://talk.pogodev.org/d/29-frequently-asked-questions) pages. This will ensure that you not only have an enjoyable time in our community but that you also avoid any potential trouble or banishment. We adhere and uphold our rules very strictly here, as that is what protects and builds our community.

If you have been around for a while (remember [Unknown6](https://github.com/pogodevorg/TU6)?)
Then you know a bit of what we're about and what we're aiming to do.

We're aiming to be the first-stop resource for everything development-wise regarding PokemonGO. We love the game and feel that is has a lot more potential than it is currently being used for. We also currently maintain documentation on the unofficial API as well as the unofficial python and golang API libraries.

However, we're always in need of help, so if you have any skillsets that you feel will be of assistance to PogoDev, please don't hesitate to get in contact with myself or any of the moderators via Discord or any of our other channels of communication.

Welcome.

### P/S

As always, please note that there are always a few impersonations of the PogoDev community circulating the internet.
At current we do not have any active **twitter** nor active **facebook** accounts, and all of our communications, news and discussions take place on our unofficial forums, reddit and discord.

* We do not, have not and will not accept money or donations of any type for **anything**.
* We do not condone any botting or automated third-party applications, whatsoever.

When in doubt, please contact us via Discord to confirm.
